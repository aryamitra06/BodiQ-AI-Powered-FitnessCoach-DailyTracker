## Project Title
BodiQ - Smart Fitness Tracking with AI Insights & Google Fit Sync

## Project Description
BodiQ is a modern, intelligent fitness tracking app that helps you log, visualize, and improve your body progress with AI-powered insights. It integrates seamlessly with Google Fit to automatically sync your daily activity data and provides powerful tools to stay on track with your goals. With interactive charts, a Goal Creator, a Body Weight Logger, and AI-driven summaries, BodiQ transforms your fitness data into clear, motivational feedback. Whether you’re aiming to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply maintain a healthy lifestyle — BodiQ keeps you focused, consistent, and inspired.

## Inspiration behind the Project
As a tech enthusiast and fitness lover, I wanted to build something that combined both my passions — technology and health. Having been working out consistently for the past two years, I’ve gained firsthand experience with the challenges of tracking progress, staying motivated, and interpreting fitness data meaningfully. I envisioned an app with a clean, modern UI and integrated AI features that not only tracks your body metrics but also analyzes trends, visualizes progress, and motivates users intelligently. That idea became BodiQ — a smart, aesthetically pleasing fitness companion built for people who take both fitness and good design seriously.
